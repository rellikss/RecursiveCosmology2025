### Overview

This project introduces a novel cosmological model grounded in recursive universe cycles, black hole bounce mechanics, and torsion-based information inheritance. Inspired by tensions in standard cosmology (ΛCDM) — such as early galaxy formation, spin alignments, and low-ℓ CMB anomalies — we propose a field-theoretic framework that simulates structure emergence without invoking dark matter or dark energy.

### Key Contributions

* **Lagrangian Formalism**:
  We construct a total Lagrangian including:

  * Fractal quantum potential (Bohm-like)
  * Entropy surface terms (holographic)
  * Torsion-spin memory gradients

* **Simulation Suite**:
  Eight original simulations model:

  * Recursive bounce dynamics
  * Shell-bound entropy fields
  * Spin inheritance across universes
  * Large-scale spin and structure emergence

* **Emergent Time & AdS/CFT Geometry**:
  Time is redefined as a radial complexity integral of entropy modes:
  [
  \tau \sim \int_{r_0}^{r} C[S(\theta, r')] , dr'
  ]
  This connects causal structure with holographic boundary data in an AdS-like foliation.

* **Dark Matter Analogue**:
  Flat galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing, and halo formations are replicated from pure field geometry — no exotic matter required.

* **ΛCDM Comparison**:
  The model reproduces key cosmological signatures using only geometric mechanisms, and suggests a new interpretation of “dark” phenomena as inherited causal structure.
