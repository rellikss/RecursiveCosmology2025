# Recursive Cosmology and Cosmic Memory (2025)

**A Fractal-Torsion Framework for Universe Evolution**  
*Author: Brett Harris · rellikss@outlook.com*

---

🚀 This project presents a novel cosmological model where the universe evolves recursively through black hole bounces — carrying forward memory in the form of torsion, spin alignment, and entropy structure.

### 🧠 Model Highlights

- **Recursive cosmology** via bounce mechanics and torsion fields  
- **Spin memory and entropy inheritance** across generations  
- **AdS/CFT embedding** and emergent time via entanglement  
- **Dark matter analogue** from geometry — no exotic particles  
- **Early galaxy maturity** explained without inflation or tuning

Simulation outputs show alignment with observations from **JWST**, **SDSS**, and **Planck**.
